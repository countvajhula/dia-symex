			* A library providing many of the primitives for transforming expressions that are used in the structural editing DSL, and ensuring that manual textual edits preserve tree structure. [75%]
			* A library that initially provided many of the transformation primitives for the structural editing DSL, and which currently is used only superficially. [20%]
			* A library that provides an Evil "text object" for a symex, which is used to compute the bounds of the expression in Symex's tidy/auto-indent function. [2.5%]
			* A library that provides the ability to operate on expression delimiters, which is used in the "change delimiter" and "splice" operations. [2.5%]
		* Non-Lisp [TODO]
			* A library providing the primitives for moving across and transforming expressions in non-Lisp languages. These primitives are used in the structural editing DSL to extend Symex's support to many non-Lisp languages. [TODO]
